                <div class="intro_text req_space">The Japanese Culinary Arts Competition is presented by Japanese Culinary Academy, Kyoto, Japan and is a biannual event in which non-Japanese chefs working abroad in Japanese cuisine or in other cuisine compete using their skills and knowledge of Japanese cuisine. This is the seventh such competition. The theme of the 7th Japanese Culinary Arts Competition is SHOKU NO HANAYAGI. The objective of SHOKU NO HANAYAGI is the achievement of a beautiful and exciting presentation for each prepared dish. The harmonious display of the five colors, red, green, orange, white and black in the prepared food itself including its container is essential to achieving this goal. Chefs utilize these five basic colors to create presentations that appeal to the diner’s eye and entertain other senses to maximize the dining experience. The competition is conducted in two phases. The contestants first compete at a regional level at one of the four world-wide regions outside Japan. The winners of the regional competitions are invited to Japan, expenses paid, for the final competition to be held in Kyoto.</div>
